# ReelKeeper

Movie tracking web app to check the movies you've watched, your favs, your watchlist and your customised lists.

ReelKeeper offers the user an attractive, minimalist and intuitive website
to manage the tracking of the films they have seen in the cinema or on their
devices through any streaming platform. The user can search for any movie
by title, view the movie details such as year, original language, synopsis,
genre/s, cast and crew, as well as recommendations of similar movies. The
user will also be able to add films to any of the three default lists (Favorites,
Watchlist, History) or to any list the user has created. As it is a SPA, the
loading time is shorter as it avoids reloading every time the page is changed.
Therefore, ReelKeeper offers a simple and attractive platform where you can
organise your films quickly and efficiently
